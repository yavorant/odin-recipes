    <h2>The recipe was super straightforward and easy to follow</h2>
    <p>
      This fideo recipe was given to me by my mother-in-law. It goes great with
      any meat dish, including carne asada. I use this recipe in place of rice
      as my side dish.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package fideo pasta</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups water, divided</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce, divided</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add fideo; cook and stir
        until browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 cup water and 1/2 of the tomato sauce to fideo. Season with chili
        powder, cumin, and garlic salt; stir to blend. Bring to a boil and cook
        until liquid has almost evaporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in remaining 1/2 cup water and remaining tomato sauce. Cover and
        cook over medium heat until fideo is tender and sauce thickens, about 10
        minutes.
